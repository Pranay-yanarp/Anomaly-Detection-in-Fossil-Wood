# Anomaly Detection in Fossil Wood

## Summary
* This repository contains Capstone Project for my Master's in Data Science. Our Project aim was to develop a method to detect different patterns in high resolution wood fossil images to classify damaged/undamaged part of the wood.
* Developed a method to detect the different patterns in high resolution wood fossil images to classify damaged and undamaged part of the wood with an accuracy of 86% by applying the PCA model on the gram matrix of output of middle layers of Resnet50 and VGG19 models
* Performed data creation by generating random cuts of various sizes, pre-processed the images, extracted haralick features from images and built base PCA model to benchmark performance of above mentioned model

This repository does not contain the codes and data that I worked because the project was done under Prof. Chen Zeng (GWU) and he contains right to all the work. Hence I could only provide the Final reports of the work.
